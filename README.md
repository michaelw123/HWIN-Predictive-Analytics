HWIN Predictive Analysis using machine learning on Spark

This is a research project that helps Ministry of Environment's HWIN enviromental compliance project. We used logistic regression and naive bayes to analyse historical user behaviour and business manifest data to make predictive analysis, and provided the ministry guidelines for compliance enforcement.
Due to the sensitivity of data, we did not include dataset here but only presented algorithms and a few presentations.
