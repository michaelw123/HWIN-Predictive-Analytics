HWIN Predictive Analysis using machine learning on Spark

This is a research project that addresses Ministry of Environment HWIN license compliance. We used logistic regression and naive bayes on historical user behaviour to make predictive analysis, and provided the ministry guidelines.
Due to the sensitivity, we did not include data here but only presented algorithms and a few presentations.
